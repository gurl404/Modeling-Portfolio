## Overview

  My project will be an online portfolio and booking site that will be used to streamline my freelance modeling career. Currently, I am dependent on social media platforms. While this has been successful so far, I would like a site that would eventually: keep all of my modeling appointments in one place, accept payments and deposits, and act as an online portfolio. Harassment and people expecting free work are common, so the goal is to create a user-friendly platform where people can book me without having access to my personal social media accounts. 

  Ideally this would take the form of a professional-looking website that I can link potential clients to. My schedule would be clearly outlined in a calendar that they can request to add appointments to and they would be able to scroll through an image gallery of my previous work. The structure of the site will require them to enter an email address, as well as their full name. Once their account is made and approved, they will be able to start the booking process.  It will limit their interaction with me in a way that Facebook does not. Any contact with me will require them to explain in detail what they would like to book me for (via required forms), inform them of my rates, and instant messaging would not be available. They will be able to submit comments and feedback, however.
